I was mainly attracted by the fact that most of the gigachad devs of the space seemed to be in love with it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was also interested in its reputation for blazing-fast performance, safety, and concurrency. If Rust‚Äôs features were so good, and blockchain devs were getting pilled, it must have been a sign that by learning it, I would be able to upskill and push the boundaries of my development skills, right?\nSo, I decided to implement the EVM from scratch, in Rust. While my implementation was minimal and far from perfect‚Äîgas calculations still pending‚Äîit worked! The library was capable of processing bytecode and manipulating data from the execution environment, load and store data from/into memory or storage, transfer ether, deploy new contracts, etc. After my initial implementation was completed, I decided to look into reth. Despite the similarities, as expected, I could directly tell that the reth repo was on a completely different level. Its implementation was way more modular, defining - and leveraging- many more custom types and traits. It became clear that to improve, I wouldn‚Äôt just achieve it by coding more; I also needed to start incorporating best practices into my work.\nI figured that most developers who were new to Rust might face a similar challenge. Therefore, I teased on Farcaster about the possibility of creating a written series to explore how Rust intersects with Ethereum projects. The reception from the community was both surprising and motivating. It became evident that there‚Äôs a collective eagerness to breach the gap between ‚Äúnot-so-idiomatic docs‚Äù and rust learnoors that want to discover how Rust can be leveraged in the Ethereum ecosystem. Inspired by this, I‚Äôve decided to embark on a series that focuses on this exciting intersection.\nThe idea is simple: to upskill by learning from the best. The core mission of this series is to deeply understand how seasoned Rust developers tackle the unique challenges of blockchain technology. This isn‚Äôt just about diving into code; it‚Äôs about understanding the technical topics behind the implementations, so that we can then comprehend the design and implementation choices that were made by those who‚Äôve mastered the art of Rust in blockchain. Through this exploration, I aim to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, learning firsthand from the work of experienced devs.\nJoin the Exploration! This series is an invitation to join me on this educational journey, where we aim to enhance our Rust skills and apply them to the ever-evolving world of Ethereum.\nStay tuned for the first chapter of the series, kicking off our exploration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with Rust.
